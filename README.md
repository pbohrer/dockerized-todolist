# dockerized Swift Todolist Server
Docker image for building and running the [TodoList-CouchDB](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/TodoList-CouchDB) application. Please note that this Docker image extends the [swift-ubuntu-docker](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/swift-ubuntu-docker) image. Hence, this image uses Ubuntu v14.04 LTS (same version found in Cloud Foundry environments, such as Bluemix).
